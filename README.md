# Corona Hakab Simulator

## Run the simulator
- setup: **python setup.py install**
- go to src/corona_hakab_model folder
- run: **python main.py**

## Workflow -
- When working, **work on a new git branch**.
- run quality test: **tox -e quality**, if it fails you might need to reformat: **tox -e reformat**
- When done, **push changes to your branch, and create a pull request**.
- **Always run the simulator after making changes and before merging**, to make sure you didn't break anything.
- Especially if not sure, **try to get at least 1 person's review before merging**.
